This mixture is cooked until thickened and cooled before being combined with whipped cream and mascarpone cheese. Ladyfingers are dipped in espresso and coffee liqueur, arranged in a baking dish, and covered with layers of the mascarpone mixture. The tiramisu is then refrigerated for at least 2 hours and dusted with cocoa powder before serving."
